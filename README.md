# Discord-Stock-Bot
Query the market for stock prices, and receive data up to 20 years in the past. Runs using the Alpha Vantage API, found here: https://www.alphavantage.co/

To use the bot, you must host it yourself. A suggestion for free hosting would be https://www.glitch.com, for which a tutorial can be found here: https://anidiots.guide/other-guides/hosting-on-glitch

To begin, first change the token and the API key to your own in the config file. Then, once the bot is up and running in Discord, type @stock help for the full commands.
